# Merge Sort: Serial, OpenMP, MPI, and Hybrid Approaches

This project implements and compares the performance of Merge Sort using four different methods:
- Serial (Single-threaded)
- OpenMP (Shared-memory parallelism)
- MPI (Distributed-memory parallelism)
- Hybrid (MPI + OpenMP)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of parallel computing paradigms in sorting large datasets. The project aims to:
- Develop merge sort implementations in serial, OpenMP, MPI, and hybrid MPI+OpenMP.
- Compare their performance using execution time, speedup, and efficiency.
- Verify correctness across all implementations.
